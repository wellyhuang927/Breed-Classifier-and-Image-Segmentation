# Breed-Classifier-and-Image-Segmentation

This project successfully leverages the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset to tackle the challenges of breed classification and segmentation. By employing transfer learning techniques, the models achieved state-of-the-art performance in both tasks. The EfficientNetV2-S model excelled in breed classification, delivering outstanding accuracy, while the MobileNetV2 model provided highly accurate segmentation results. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of modern deep learning architectures in handling complex computer vision tasks related to animal images.
